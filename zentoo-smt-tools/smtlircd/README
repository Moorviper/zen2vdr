Introduction
------------

Zenegafbd is a remote control daemon for the Zenega 101S CI and possibly other
similar satelite receiver set-top-boxes available today.
The Zenega line of set top boxes with DVB capabilities use 2 different 
controllers for DVB and IP-TV. These are interconnected using a serial line
and utilize a simple message protocol for sending and receiving messages.
Zenegafbd is needed to make the two work together.


Installing
----------

Simply type 'make && make install'.
Then set zenegafbd up so it is started at boot time.

Supported Functions
----------------------

- Switching to Linux and back to Satelite tuner.
- Setting the clock ( initially )
- Selecting TV mode ( backend missing )
- Setting IP info ( backend missing )
- Setting master volume on linux.

Have fun.
