Introduction
------------

This collection of scripts aids the building of the VDR software package
in a number of configurations, either locally or into another system.
The process of building and installing is split into three parts that are
called by the main script:
1st: prep() -     This is used to prepare the source package.
                  Download, extract, patch, configure.

2nd: install() -  This is used to install the packages.
                  Either by the books (make install) or by hand.

3rd: config() -   This can be used to process specific config files
                  if needed.

Installing
----------

Simply type './vdr-build.sh' this will install things locally.
