# or plugin is to be installed into the VDR build environment.
#
# Functions within the script are:
#
#  - prep(): To configure a plugin before compiling VDR or to patch VDR
#
#  - install(): To install a plugin or feature package or its components
#
#  - config(): To write a VDR config options file for this feature or package
